## The project was biult using:

- React
- Typescript
- Pure CSS
- Font Awesome

## Considerations

It was a pleasant challenge that provided me the opportunity to put into practice some concepts/tags that I've never used before such as <em>audio tag</em>, and <em>range input</em>

I'd like to have more time to experiment little more the animations and transitions.
I focused on make it work properly and lightweight.
